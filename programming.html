Want to watch others do just that? Then the cosplay contest is for you. Contestants show off the cosplays they’ve made on stage for the audience, in hopes of taking home that coveted best in show award.</p>

The tasks will be ridiculous, and the dialogue will be hilarious. The winner takes home a prize, and the losers take home their disappointment… and consolation prizes. Contestants face off in several elimination rounds until the final round, an amazing obstacle course that runs throughout the room!</p>
