##Dress Code

Louisianime has a PG-13 dress code policy. Generally anything you wear on the convention floor needs to cover as much as modest swimwear.

- No bare feet
- No nudity
- No exposed breasts or behinds (no thongs, see through undergarments, ect.)
- Bikini costumes are allowed as long as all areas are covered appropriately.
- Louisianime staff reserves the right to request anyone change if they deem that the attendee is not dress appropriately in accordance with the hotel dress policy.


##Weapons Policy

Louisianime will be providing weapons check at the cosplay table on site at the convention. If you have a prop weapon you will need to have it checked. Props will be marked with a zip tie.

- Anything that could be used as a weapon must be peace bonded.
- No live steel (Live steel is defined as swords, knives, or other objects made of metal, which can take an edge.)
- Ammunition for replica guns and other projectile replica weapons will not be allowed.
- All replica guns must be marked with an orange safety tip
- Do not brandish and/or act irresponsibly with a weapon or prop. If you are found acting in a manor that is deemed irresponsible by staff your badge may be revoked.
- If staff cannot tell your weapon is a prop from 10 feet away, you probably should not bring it.
