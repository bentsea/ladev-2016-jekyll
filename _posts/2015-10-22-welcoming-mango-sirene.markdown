<p>Nina (“Mango Sirene”) Stockman is a cosplayer and YouTube vlogger based in the Midwest United States.. After discovering cosplay back in 2007, she was instantly hooked. Despite having no prior experience with clothing fabrication, she jumped headfirst into the world of costuming, quickly teaching herself how to sew, style wigs, make props, and model her outfits.</p>
<p>Nina has been an active member of the cosplay community since then, having made more than 90 costumes over the past nine years. Her YouTube channel, which focuses on tutorials, cosplay vlogs, and convention reviews, has garnered over 2.5 million views and 60,000 subscribers. Using her degree in fashion design and her prior experience in theater, she frequently acts as a craftsmanship and performance judge for convention masquerades, and she herself has taken home several awards, including Best In Show and Best Skit Performance. Her focus behind everything she does is on creating a welcoming environment for those who are new to the hobby, all the while maintaining focus on the most important aspect of cosplay: having fun and striving to do your very best!</p>
