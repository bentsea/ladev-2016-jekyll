We've already announced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/louisianime">our Facebook</a> that we're going to upgrade one of the hotel rooms reserved by April 5th to a suite for the entire weekend, but in case you missed it, there it is! Just call the Ramada and reserve your hotel room for LouisiANIME 2015 by April fifth and you'll be entered into a drawing to have your room upgraded.

Oh, but we have more great news. Every year we have really enjoyed sharing workshops with you, and this year we're going to make workshops like Leather Working and Tea Tasting even better. How? By making them free. No more fees to cover materials, for 2015, we've got this one. These are on us, and we hope you all love them this year as much as we love having you all attend with us.

It's a brand new year and it seems like the year has just breezed by, especially after the holidays. We truly hope that everyone had as great of a 2014 as we did, and we're looking forward to seeing everyone again in May. Happy New Year!
