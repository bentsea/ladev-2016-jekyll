<p>We are very excited to welcome back Eric Cherry to LouisiANIME!</p>

<p>Eric, or “Cherry” as many of us know him as, has been a major part of the anime community in Central Texas since the beginning of the new millenium. As a stage actor out of high school, he quickly became involved in multiple cosplay performance groups in North Texas, winning multiple events at A­Kon and Animefest in Dallas. This passion for anime and a gregarious personality lead to his meeting with and auditioning at FUNimation Entertainment.</p>

<p>In that time, Eric has been in more than 23 series. He can be heard in FUNimations newest series, Assassination Classroom as Takuya Muramatsu ​along with parts in Ben­To and Space Dandy and the international hit series, Attack on Titan. He has also been in many fan favorites such as: Fairy Tail, KenIchi the Mightiest Disciple, Initial D and One Piece to name a few.</p>
