<p>Jillian (a.k.a. Shark Baroness) has been making and wearing costumes for 5 years and has created over 40 costumes since she began. She is self-taught and enjoys learning and developing skills related to all aspects of the costuming process; whether it's sewing, prop/armor-making, wig-styling, make-up techniques, or modeling.</p>


<p>Jillian frequently participates in highly competitive masquerades and has won awards for her costume craftsmanship and performance. She also regularly judges costume contests and hosts panels relating to cosplay. Jillian is known by her friends in the community as a chameleon of cosplay, due to her skill in tackling a variety of character types and appearances. She is excited to share her knowledge and love of the craft with the attendees of Louisianime!</p>
