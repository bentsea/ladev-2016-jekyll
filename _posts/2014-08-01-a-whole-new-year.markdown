Hello, and welcome to the all new LouisiANIME home page! We’re at Mechacon this weekend while we launch this, and we’re very excited right now. Everything is moving really fast this year as we try to have everything setup in record time this year. Be sure to check here and FaceBook for updates regularly as we announce guests and special information. 

You can already make reservations at our awesome new hotel for as low as 79$, as well as already pre-register for a full weekend membership or our new VIP membership! We’ll be announcing more features and value for the VIP membership in the coming weeks, but be aware, we’re only selling 50 of them!

And finally, we’re already accepting panel submissions this year. We’re going to have this open and ready longer to help have a finalized schedule much sooner for all of you this year.
