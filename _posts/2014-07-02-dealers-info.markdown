At LouisiANIME, we bring together all sorts of vendors who sell quality merchandise such as DVDs, t-shirts, costume props, games, figures.  The dealers room is a fun and convenient place to buy products that cater to fans of pop culture and anime that are not readily available in local stores.  Every year we bring in some new vendors to sell alongside the veteran dealers in order to ensure an ever changing and current line of products assembled for you, the LouisiANIME attendee.

LouisiANIME is proud to have hosted a wide variety of Dealers in years past, such as:

* Anime Jutsu
* Anime Pavillion
* Anime Pop
* Anime Remix
* Octane Toys
* Wayne’s Comic Closet
* Yuki Pearl

Dealers for 2015:
In the coming months we will be announcing dealers for LouisiANIME 2015.
