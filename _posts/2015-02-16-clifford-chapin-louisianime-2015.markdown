Clifford is a newbie in the anime voice over world with his breakout role being Keita Tsuwabuki
in Good Luck Girl! BinbogamiÂ­Ga! Since then, Clifford has gone on to voice roles across the
many anime worlds, including Kaito Yashio in third installment of the Science Adventure series
Robotics;Notes and most recently Conny Springer in Attack on Titan! Outside of his voice
acting work, Clifford spends his time gaming and telling (really bad) jokes on the internet! He's
really excited to be attending LouisiAnime VI and hopes to have a great time with all of you! You
can keep up with all of Clifford's voice acting and bad comedy antics by following him on Twitter
(@CliffordChapin) and liking his "Clifford Chapin (Voice Actor)" page on Facebook.
