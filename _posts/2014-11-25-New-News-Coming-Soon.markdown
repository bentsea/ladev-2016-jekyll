We've been hard at work contacting guests and reviewing a lot of the feedback we've received from everyone after this year. We're set to start making announcements soon that we think will really start getting everyone excited in addition to the changes we've already made and the new venue that we've moved to. 

We'd also love to hear any guest requests you have, as we are always trying to listen to you and make the best convention possible. We're always watching our Facebook messages, and our email for any questions or suggestions you have. We also plan to start regularly streaming games on twitch when we'll be available for you to talk to us directly in live chat for questions, suggestions, and feedback. Looking forward to the next few months of announcements, we think you'll be as excited for LouisiANIME 2015 as we are!
