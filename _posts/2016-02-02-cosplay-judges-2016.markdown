##2016 Baton Rouge Cosplay Judges

LouisiANIME is excited to announce that Shark Baroness, Mango Sirene and Ubergeeks Cosplay will be judging the cosplay contest for our 2016 show in Baton Rouge! Each guest brings years of experience in their own fields and are excited to participate in our contest this year.

Founded officially in 2014 as a competitive duo, they competed and won their first best in show for Alphonse Elric at Mechacon. Since then, they have added an official third member as a handler and gone on to win 4 consecutive best in show awards in 15 months, most recently winning best in show at Wizard World New Orleans 2016. The concept behind Team UGC is simple: teach. Understanding building methods and pushing information out there is their most important goal and the entire reason the group was formed.

Tripp the Tech, also known as UberGeek Tripp, is one of the two founding members of team UGC. Other than fabricating, Tripp specializes in the tech factors of costumes. His roles include all of the 3d modeling, Pepakura, lighting effects, coding and generally giving the wow factor to everything we do. Want to know how to make something work? Need to understand the technical aspects of creating effects and lighting? Ask Tripp. With over 12 years in the computer/coding industry, he is the go to guy in team UGC for all things technical.

Cayne the creator, also known as UberGeek Cayne, is the other half of the founding members, Cayne began 15 years ago sewing. Her role is concept, design and execution of the cosplays. No detail is too small for her nor is anything safe! Cayne prides herself on her vast use of multiple materials, ranging from foam, leather, bondo, Sintra and of course fabrics. If it sits still long enough, it will get put in a cosplay. Cosplay on a budget? Need to understand how to modify a pattern using only some duct tape and twine? Ask Cayne.

Lorax the lifesaver, also known as UberGeek Lorax. Handlers are important! Lorax joined team UGC in 2014 and since then has been the most important part of this team. Responsible for keeping both Tripp and Cayne in line as well as ensuring they do the important things (like reminding them to eat).
