Regulars of the LouisiANIME tea tasting panels will all recognize Adagio.com. We've been preparing tea for you to taste from Adagio for as long as we have been holding this panel. This year we are proud to announce that Adagio is an official sponsor of LouisiANIME and our tea panel. Adagio will be providing a complimentary tin of loose leaf tea to everyone who attends this years tea tasting. These special tins will be labeled with art of our mascots, and we just know that all of the fans of tea who will be joining us this year will absolutely love them. Also, don't forget that this year the tea tasting will be a free panel to all.

Also, don't forget that this year our incredibly popular leatherworking panel, brought to you by Airship Isabella, will also be free to all for the first time. We're looking forward to everyone being able to enjoy hand crafted leather crafts to take home after the show and show off. Both of these panels will be first come first serve, so if you want to guarantee your seating with early entrance, then be sure to get our VIP pass this year for early seating for all panels, as well as early entrance into the dealer's room every day.

We're still deciding what teas to sample this year and to serve at this year's lolita tea party, so if there's a special tea you want to try, be sure to let us know so that we can add it to our list for the year.
