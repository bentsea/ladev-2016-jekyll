	<h3>Felecia Angelle</h3>

	Felecia Angelle is a voice actress in Dallas, TX by way of Lafayette, LA. Her hobbies include
	reading, playing videogames (poorly), and trying really hard to get someone else to write her
	bio. You can hear her voice all up in your anime, as well as coming through the TV to sell
	toys to your kids. Felecia loves character work almost as much as she loves eating too much
	pizza and taking naps. Her recent work includes Coco in “Fairy Tail”, Mero in “Sankarea”,
	Sakura in “Evangelion 3.0′′, and Raynare/Yuma in “High School DXD”.
