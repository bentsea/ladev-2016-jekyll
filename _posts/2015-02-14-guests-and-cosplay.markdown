We here at LouisiANIME are very much hoping that everyone had a wonderful Valentine's Day yesterday. Many of us are also celebrating 50% off candy today at any local store that purchased way too many chocolates for Valentine's. Last week we made our first two guest announcements for 2015. We're very excited to have both Clifford Chapin and Felicia Angelle return to this year's event. Their work as voice actors is excellent, and you can read more about them both on our <a href="/guests/">Guest Bio</a> page. We have a few more guests to announce and we are extremely excited for all the news we'll be spreading out over the next few weeks.

If you've kept an eye on our Facebook page, you'll have noticed that we've announced our cosplay team for 2015. SanctuaryMemories and Miss OoLaLa are both Louisiana natives and both have years of experience with the cosplay community. In addition, we've already posted our entry guidlines as well as forms for contenstants to begin entering in the competition. You can read all of the applicable details on our <a href="/cosplay/">Cosplay</a> page. We're looking forward to being surrounded by all of your wonderful cosplay throughout the weekend.

If you have any questions, feel free to email us, or message us on Facebook, and we'll be more than happy to provide answers. Enjoy your weekend!
